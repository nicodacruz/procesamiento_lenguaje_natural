Tiene sentido ya que en texto multiclase, CNB suele manejar mejor el desbalance y descontar términos comunes que no ayudan a diferenciar. Los avisos de combinaciones inválidas vienen de algunos parámetros del grid que no van con NB; el search los descarta y no afectan al mejor modelo."

        "Con las semillas inflation, prices, market, policy los vecindarios mejoraron respecto de la corrida automática previa (que devolvía solo stopwords). Se ven términos que sí tienen relación temática, por ejemplo con inflation aparecen salary y mortgage, y con policy surgen adjetivos y calificativos como unfavorable o laudable que suelen co-ocurrir en textos de opinión. Al mismo tiempo, aparecen ruidos y rarezas del vocabulario (fv, thatn, stragegy, resoltuion, belike, nombres propios como edmund, o irish con market). Eso sugiere que el corpus incluye typos, tokens poco frecuentes y entidades propias que arrastran similitud por co-ocurrencia, aun si no aportan significado directo. En síntesis, al elegir palabras de contenido mejora la interpretabilidad de los top-5 similares, pero la calidad final todavía depende del ruido del vocabulario disponible: conviven vecinos útiles (ej., salary, mortgage con inflation) con términos residuales o poco interpretables que reflejan la dispersión y errores ortográficos presentes en los textos."
